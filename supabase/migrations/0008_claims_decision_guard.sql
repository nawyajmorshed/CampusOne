-- CampusOne — Migration 0008: harden Lost & Found claim decisions
-- The poster owns claim decisions (0005), but nothing constrained WHAT could
-- change. This adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger so that:
--   • the claimant-authored fields (claimant_id, item_id, kind, message,
--     proof_url, code) can never be edited by the poster;
--   • a claim can only move Pending -> Approved/Rejected, exactly once
--     (no re-deciding / toggling the contact reveal on and off);
--   • at most ONE claim per item can be Approved (prevents a poster from
--     approving many claims to harvest several students' private contacts),
--     and none once the item is Resolved.
-- Runs alongside the existing stamp_claim_decision trigger (which sets
-- decided_by/decided_at); this guard fires first and only validates.

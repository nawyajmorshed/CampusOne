-- CampusOne — Migration 0010: private bucket for Lost & Found claim proofs
-- Report/item photos stay in the public "photos" bucket. Claim PROOF images
-- (which may show IDs, receipts, serial numbers) move to a PRIVATE "proofs"
-- bucket, viewable only by:
--   • the uploader (the claimant), and
--   • the poster of the item the proof's claim belongs to.
-- The app stores the object PATH in claims.proof_url and views it through a
-- short-lived signed URL (see store.jsx getProofUrl).
-- ============================================================================

-- Upload: any signed-in user may upload a proof (the claim insert itself is
-- separately gated by the claims RLS policy).

-- Read: the uploader, or the poster of the item this proof's claim is on.

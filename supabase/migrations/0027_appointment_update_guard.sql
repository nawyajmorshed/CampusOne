-- CampusOne — Migration 0027: guard appointment updates
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- appts_update (0016) allowed the owning student to update their row with no
-- column/transition guard (unlike reports/claims). Two reachable abuses:
--   • a student could self-advance status Booked -> Confirmed/Completed via a
--     direct API call, forging a clinic decision that only an admin should make;
--   • a student could change doctor_id/date/slot after booking, but the queue
--     token (set only on INSERT, per-doctor-per-day) was never recomputed — so
--     a moved appointment could collide with another patient's token (the same
--     class of bug 0024 fixed for cancel+rebook).
-- This adds a BEFORE UPDATE guard (mirroring guard_claim_update /
-- guard_report_update): non-admins may ONLY cancel — booking identity
-- (doctor/date/slot/token/code) is frozen, and the only status they may set is
-- 'Cancelled'. Admins (the DoctorQueue path) keep full freedom via the early
-- return. Rescheduling = cancel + rebook, which keeps tokens correct.

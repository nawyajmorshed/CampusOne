-- CampusOne — Migration 0024: monotonic appointment tokens (fix duplicate tokens)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- BUG: the original set_appointment_token() (0016) computed the token as
-- count(non-cancelled appointments for doctor+date) + 1. Because cancelled rows
-- were excluded from the count, cancelling an earlier booking let a later
-- booking re-derive an already-issued number — so two LIVE appointments on the
-- same doctor+day could share a token (the token is the patient's queue id, so
-- two people get told to present the same number).
--
-- FIX: derive the next number from the MAX token ever issued for that
-- (doctor_id, date) across ALL rows (including cancelled), so numbers are
-- monotonic and never reused. Re-creating the function is enough; the existing
-- BEFORE INSERT trigger (appointments_set_token) already calls it by name.

-- CampusOne — Migration 0025: tighten report update guards
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The reports_update policy (0007) lets the assigned staff update the row, and
-- guard_report_update (0014) only protected reporter_id, assigned_staff_id, and
-- WHO may change status. Two gaps remained, both reachable by a direct API call:
--   • deleted_at was unguarded, so an assigned staff member could soft-delete
--     (hide) a report — beyond the documented "owner-while-Open" delete rule.
--   • the status state-machine wasn't enforced, so assigned staff could set
--     admin-only statuses (Rejected/Closed) or skip steps (Open->Resolved),
--     bypassing the staff workflow shown in the UI.
-- This re-creates the guard to (a) allow a deleted_at change only when the
-- reporter is soft-deleting their own still-Open report (admins exempt), and
-- (b) restrict assigned-staff status moves to Open->In Progress and
-- In Progress->Resolved. Admins keep full freedom via the early return.

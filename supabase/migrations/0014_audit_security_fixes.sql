-- CampusOne — Migration 0014: security fixes from the final audit
--  1. CRITICAL — connections: the addressee could rewrite requester_id when
--     accepting, forging a non-consensual "accepted" connection and stealing
--     the victim's contact. Make the parties + created_at immutable on UPDATE.
--  2. HIGH — reports: a reporter could self-assign + set any status in one
--     UPDATE, bypassing the workflow. Lock down who may change status /
--     reporter_id / assigned_staff_id.
--  3. HIGH — claims: the "one approved claim per item" rule was a non-atomic
--     check (TOCTOU). Back it with a partial unique index so two concurrent
--     approvals can't both succeed.
--  4. MEDIUM — profiles: a user could change their own id/email via the
--     table-wide UPDATE grant. Make id + email immutable here (managed by Auth).
